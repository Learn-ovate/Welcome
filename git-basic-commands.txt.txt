git clone LOCATIONOFREPOSITORY.COM

git status
 -- Shows if there are unpushed files which are updated or not committed to the servers

git checkout -b NEWBRANCHNAME
 -- Creates a new branch named NEWBRANCHNAME into your local machine. Before creating the branch, make sure that you are in the folder that is created after cloning the repository. Use "cd DIRECTORYNAME" command to change the folder and "ls" to see the contents of the current folder.

git checkout BRANCHNAME

git push origin BRANCHNAME
