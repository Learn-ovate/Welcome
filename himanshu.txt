Hello, Guys 
I'm Himanshu Patel from 2nd Year CP.
I have great passion for programming, so that's why I'm here. I have been in TOP 30 in TCS Mock Codevita. :) Currently, I'm interested in Web Designing, So I'm learning it. 
I also love travelling and photography. I have respect for every entrepreneur for what they have done and sacrifice for doing new.
